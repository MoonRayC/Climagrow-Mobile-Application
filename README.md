ClimaGrow is a machine learning-powered crop recommendation system designed to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in selecting the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil data. Leveraging algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors, the model analyzes patterns to provide accurate, data-driven crop suggestions for optimized yield.

## Features ✨

- 🌾 **Smart Crop Recommendations**: Get personalized crop suggestions based on environmental factors
- 📅 **Historical Data**: View your previous recommendations with location data
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for all users
- 🤖 **Data-Driven Insights**: Powered by machine learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors)
- 📍 **Location-Based Suggestions**: Recommendations tailored to your specific geographic location
- 🔄 **Result History**: Save and revisit your previous recommendations
